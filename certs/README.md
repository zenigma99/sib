# SIB mTLS Certificates

This directory contains certificates for mTLS (mutual TLS) communication between SIB components.

## Quick Start

Generate all certificates (CA, server, local client):

```bash
make generate-certs
```

Generate certificate for a specific fleet host:

```bash
make generate-client-cert HOST=my-fleet-host
```

Generate certificates for all hosts in Ansible inventory:

```bash
make generate-fleet-certs
```

## Security Notes

- **NEVER commit private keys (*.key files) to version control**
- The `.gitignore` is configured to exclude sensitive files
- Store CA private key (`ca/ca.key`) securely - it can sign any certificate
- Rotate certificates before expiration (default: 1 year for certs, 5 years for CA)
- Use strong passphrases if you encrypt the CA key

## Certificate Validity

| Certificate | Default Validity | Environment Variable |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| CA          | 5 years (1825 days) | `CA_VALIDITY_DAYS` |
| Server      | 1 year (365 days) | `CERT_VALIDITY_DAYS` |
| Client      | 1 year (365 days) | `CERT_VALIDITY_DAYS` |

## Verification

Verify all certificates:

```bash
./scripts/generate-certs.sh verify
```

Or manually verify a certificate:

```bash
# Verify server cert against CA
openssl verify -CAfile certs/ca/ca.crt certs/server/server.crt

# View certificate details
openssl x509 -in certs/server/server.crt -text -noout

# Check certificate expiration
openssl x509 -in certs/server/server.crt -noout -dates
```

## Regenerating Certificates

If you need to regenerate certificates (e.g., CA compromise, expiration):

1. **Regenerate CA** (invalidates ALL existing certs):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-certs.sh ca
   ./scripts/generate-certs.sh server
   ./scripts/generate-fleet-certs.sh --force
   ```

2. **Regenerate server cert only**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-certs.sh server
   make restart-alerting
   ```

3. **Regenerate single client cert**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate-client-cert.sh hostname
   make deploy-fleet LIMIT=hostname
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate verification failed
```bash
# Check if cert was signed by CA
openssl verify -CAfile certs/ca/ca.crt certs/clients/hostname.crt
```

### Connection refused with TLS
```bash
# Test TLS connection
openssl s_client -connect localhost:2801 -CAfile certs/ca/ca.crt \
    -cert certs/clients/local.crt -key certs/clients/local.key
```

### Check server certificate SANs
```bash
openssl x509 -in certs/server/server.crt -noout -text | grep -A1 "Subject Alternative Name"
```
