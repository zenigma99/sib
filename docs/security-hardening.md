# Security Hardening

Practical steps to secure a production SIB deployment.

[← Back to Home](index.md)

---

## 1) Lock Down External Ports

Only expose what you need. By default:
- **Grafana** (3000) is public-facing
- **Sidekick API** (2801) is public-facing (required for fleet)
- Storage backends should remain internal:
  - **VictoriaMetrics stack** (default): VictoriaLogs (9428), VictoriaMetrics (8428)
  - **Grafana stack**: Loki (3100), Prometheus (9090)

Use a firewall to restrict access to trusted IP ranges.

---

## 2) Grafana Password

A secure password is **auto-generated** during `make install`.

To view it:
```bash
grep GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD .env
```

To set a custom password before install:
```bash
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-strong-password
```

---

## 3) TLS and Reverse Proxy

Place Grafana behind a reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy/Traefik) and enable TLS.
This lets you:
- Terminate HTTPS
- Add auth (basic auth/OIDC)
- Rate-limit access

---

## 4) Restrict Fleet Ingress

Allow only fleet subnet to reach Sidekick (and storage if remote enabled):

```bash
# Sidekick (always needed for fleet)
ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 2801

# VictoriaMetrics stack (default)
ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 9428  # VictoriaLogs
ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8428  # VictoriaMetrics

# Grafana stack (STACK=grafana)
# ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 3100  # Loki
# ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 9090  # Prometheus
```

---

## 5) Enable mTLS for Fleet Communication

For encrypted and authenticated communication between fleet agents and SIB server, enable mutual TLS.

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Generate certificates (CA, server, local client)
make generate-certs

# 2. Enable mTLS
echo "MTLS_ENABLED=true" >> .env

# 3. Reinstall to apply
make install
```

### Fleet Deployment with mTLS

```bash
# Generate client certs for each fleet host
make generate-client-cert HOST=hostname

# Or generate for all hosts in Ansible inventory
make generate-fleet-certs

# Deploy via Ansible
make deploy-fleet  # Uses mtls_enabled from inventory
```

### What mTLS Protects

| Communication Path | Without mTLS | With mTLS |
|--------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Falco → Falcosidekick | HTTP (plaintext) | HTTPS + client cert |
| Fleet Falco → Sidekick | HTTP (plaintext) | HTTPS + client cert |

### Certificate Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make generate-certs` | Generate CA, server, and local client certs |
| `make generate-client-cert HOST=name` | Generate cert for specific host |
| `make generate-fleet-certs` | Generate certs for all fleet hosts |
| `make verify-certs` | Verify certificate chain |
| `make rotate-certs` | Regenerate all certificates |
| `make test-mtls` | Test mTLS connection |

### Certificate Locations

| Location | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `certs/ca/ca.crt` | Certificate Authority (public) |
| `certs/ca/ca.key` | CA private key (SECRET!) |
| `certs/server/server.crt` | Server certificate |
| `certs/server/server.key` | Server private key |
| `certs/clients/*.crt` | Client certificates |

### Ansible Configuration

Enable mTLS in `ansible/inventory/group_vars/all.yml`:

```yaml
mtls_enabled: true
```

---

## 6) Reduce Data Retention

Adjust retention to avoid disk exhaustion. Configure in `.env`:

**VictoriaMetrics stack (default):**
```bash
VICTORIALOGS_RETENTION_PERIOD=168h    # 7 days
VICTORIAMETRICS_RETENTION_PERIOD=15d  # 15 days
```

**Grafana stack:**
```bash
LOKI_RETENTION_PERIOD=168h            # 7 days
PROMETHEUS_RETENTION_TIME=15d         # 15 days
PROMETHEUS_RETENTION_SIZE=5GB         # Disk-based limit
```

Or edit config files directly:
- Loki: `storage/config/loki-config.yml`
- Prometheus: `storage/compose-grafana.yaml` (command args)

---

## 7) Backups

Back up Grafana and storage data volumes regularly. Ensure your backup target is secure and encrypted.

**Docker volumes to back up:**
```bash
# Grafana
grafana_grafana-data

# VictoriaMetrics stack (default)
storage_victorialogs-data
storage_victoriametrics-data

# Grafana stack
storage_loki-data
storage_prometheus-data
```

---

## 8) Run Health Checks

```bash
make health
make doctor
```

---

## 9) Monitor Resource Usage

Track disk and memory growth. Tune retention and sampling as needed.
