## 60-Second Demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matijazezelj/sib.git
cd sib
cp .env.example .env
make install
make demo
```

Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000 and watch the dashboards light up!

## Understanding the Demo

The `make demo` command generates realistic security events across all MITRE ATT&CK categories. The demo spins up a temporary container and triggers various Falco rules.

### Demo Coverage

| Tactic | Events Generated |
|--------|------------------|
| **Credential Access** | Shadow file access, /etc/passwd reads |
| **Execution** | Shell spawning, script execution |
| **Persistence** | Cron job creation, systemd manipulation |
| **Defense Evasion** | Log clearing, history deletion |
| **Discovery** | System enumeration, network scanning |
| **Impact** | Crypto miner detection |
| **Container Escape** | Docker socket access, namespace breakout |
| **Lateral Movement** | SSH key access, authorized_keys reads |
| **File Integrity** | /etc/ file modifications |

### Demo Options

```bash
# Full comprehensive demo (~30 events with 3s delays)
make demo

# Quick demo (1-second delays)
make demo-quick

# Single test alert
make test-alert
```

## Exploring the Dashboards

### Security Overview

Navigate to **Dashboards** → **Security Overview**

![Security Overview](assets/images/security-overview.png)

This dashboard shows:
- Total events, Critical/Error/Warning/Notice counts
- Events over time by priority
- Events by rule (pie chart)
- Critical Events panel
- Recent security events log

### Events Explorer

Navigate to **Dashboards** → **Events Explorer**

![Events Explorer](assets/images/events-explorer.png)

Features:
- Query help with LogQL examples
- Event volume by rule
- Filterable log view with priority and rule filters

### MITRE ATT&CK Coverage

Navigate to **Dashboards** → **MITRE ATT&CK Coverage**

![MITRE ATT&CK Dashboard](assets/images/mitre-attack-dashboard.png)

This dashboard maps all detections to the ATT&CK framework:
- 12 stat panels showing detection counts for each tactic
- Timeline view of events by tactic
- Technique breakdown table
- Priority distribution pie chart

### Fleet Overview

Navigate to **Dashboards** → **Fleet Overview**

![Fleet Overview](assets/images/fleet-overview.png)

Monitor multiple hosts:
- Active hosts with collectors
- CPU, memory, disk usage per host
- Network traffic graphs
- Log volume by host
- Hostname selector to filter all panels

## Verifying the Pipeline

Run the pipeline test to ensure everything is working:

```bash
./scripts/test-pipeline.sh
```

This script:
1. Checks if all containers are running
2. Generates a test event
3. Verifies the event reaches Loki
4. Confirms Grafana can query the event

Expected output:
```
[✓] Falco is running
[✓] Falcosidekick is running
[✓] Loki is running
[✓] Grafana is running
[✓] Test event generated
[✓] Event found in Loki
[✓] Pipeline is working correctly!
```

make logs-grafana

# Restart all services
make restart

# Stop all services

## What Gets Detected?

Out of the box, SIB catches:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Credential Access** | Reading /etc/shadow, SSH key access |
| **Container Security** | Shells in containers, privileged operations |
| **File Integrity** | Writes to /etc, sensitive config changes |
| **Process Anomalies** | Unexpected binaries, shell spawning |
| **Persistence** | Cron modifications, systemd changes |
| **Cryptomining** | Mining processes, pool connections |
| **Defense Evasion** | Log clearing, timestomping |
| **Discovery** | System enumeration, network scanning |
| **Lateral Movement** | SSH from containers, remote file copy |
| **Exfiltration** | Curl uploads, DNS tunneling indicators |

---

## Next Steps

Now that you've seen SIB in action:

1. **Add custom rules** — See [Custom Rules](#custom-rules) below
2. **Deploy to fleet** — [Fleet Management](fleet.md)
3. **Enable AI analysis** — [AI Analysis](ai-analysis.md)
4. **Update threat intel** — Run `make update-threatintel`

---

## Custom Rules

Add your own detection rules in `detection/config/rules/custom_rules.yaml`:

```yaml
- rule: Detect Cryptocurrency Mining
  desc: Detect cryptocurrency mining processes
  condition: >
    spawned_process and 
    proc.name in (xmrig, minerd, cpuminer)
  output: "Crypto miner detected (user=%user.name cmd=%proc.cmdline)"
  priority: CRITICAL
  tags: [cryptomining, mitre_impact]
```

After adding rules:
```bash
make restart
```

---

## Configuring Alert Outputs

Send alerts to Slack, PagerDuty, and more. Edit `alerting/config/config.yaml`:

```yaml
slack:
  webhookurl: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ"
  minimumpriority: "warning"

pagerduty:
  routingkey: "your-routing-key"
  minimumpriority: "critical"
```

Falcosidekick supports 50+ outputs. See the [Falcosidekick documentation](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick) for all options.
