## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in SIB, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers privately
3. Provide:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a timeline for resolution.

## Security Considerations

### Container Privileges

SIB uses privileged containers for Falco syscall monitoring. This is required for security monitoring but has implications:

- **Falco container** runs with `--privileged` to access kernel syscalls
- **Podman users** must run in rootful mode (`sudo podman`)
- Only run on trusted hosts

### Network Security

Default configuration:
- Services bind to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only)
- Use `make enable-remote` to expose services

Recommendations:
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Use VPN or private network for remote collectors
- Change default Grafana password immediately

### API Keys

For AI Analysis:
- Store API keys in `.env` file (never commit)
- `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- Use environment variables in production

### Data Privacy

The AI Analysis feature:
- Obfuscates sensitive data before LLM analysis
- Supports Ollama for fully local, private analysis
- Configure obfuscation level in `analysis/config.yaml`

## Security Best Practices

1. **Change default passwords**
   ```bash
   # Edit .env and change GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

2. **Keep images updated**
   ```bash
   make update
   ```

3. **Review Falco rules**
   ```bash
   make test-rules
   ```

4. **Monitor SIB health**
   ```bash
   make health
   make doctor
   ```

5. **Restrict network access**
   - Keep `STORAGE_BIND=127.0.0.1` unless needed
   - Use firewall rules for remote access

## Known Limitations

- Falco requires kernel access, which needs privileged mode
- TLS is not enabled by default between components
- Authentication between internal services relies on network isolation
