# Roadmap

This is a living roadmap. Priorities may shift based on feedback and community contributions.

## 0–3 months
- Add CI for linting and basic smoke checks
- Improve onboarding: minimal install, FAQ, and hardening guide
- Publish container images for optional components
- Add upgrade notes and versioned releases

## 3–6 months
- Rule packs and templates for common environments
- Dashboards for compliance views (e.g., CIS focus)
- Better alert enrichment (GeoIP, asset tags)
- Lightweight installer script for fresh hosts

## 6–12 months
- Multi-tenant mode for MSP or shared environments
- Built-in alert correlation rules
- Pluggable rule marketplace
- Expanded integrations (SOAR/webhooks)

## How you can help
- Testing on different distros/kernel versions
- Writing or tuning detection rules
- Creating dashboards and docs
- Reporting bugs and UX issues
