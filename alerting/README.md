This directory contains Falcosidekick for forwarding Falco alerts to various outputs.

## Components

| Service | Port | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Falcosidekick** | 2801 | Alert forwarding daemon |

## What is Falcosidekick?

Falcosidekick is a simple daemon that takes Falco events and forwards them to different outputs. It supports 50+ destinations including:

### Chat
- Slack, Discord, Teams, Mattermost, Telegram

### Alerting
- PagerDuty, Opsgenie, AlertManager

### Logs/SIEM
- Elasticsearch, Loki, Splunk, Datadog

### Message Queues
- Kafka, NATS, RabbitMQ, SQS

### Serverless
- AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions

## Configuration

Edit `config/config.yaml` to configure outputs.

### Example: Slack
```yaml
slack:
  webhookurl: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ"
  channel: "#security-alerts"
  minimumpriority: "warning"
```

### Example: Elasticsearch
```yaml
elasticsearch:
  hostport: "http://elasticsearch:9200"
  index: "falco"
  type: "_doc"
```

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/` | Main endpoint for Falco events |
| `/healthz` | Health check |
| `/test` | Generate test event |
| `/metrics` | Prometheus metrics |

## mTLS Configuration

For production deployments, enable mTLS to require client certificate authentication.

### Enable mTLS

```bash
# Set environment variable
echo "MTLS_ENABLED=true" >> .env

# Generate certificates (if not already done)
make generate-certs

# Reinstall alerting stack
make install-alerting
```

### Configuration

When `MTLS_ENABLED=true`, Falcosidekick is configured with:

```yaml
tlsserver:
  deploy: true
  certfile: /certs/server/server.crt
  keyfile: /certs/server/server.key
  mutualtls: true
  cacertfile: /certs/ca/ca.crt
```

### Test mTLS Connection

```bash
# Without client cert (should fail)
curl https://localhost:2801/healthz --cacert certs/ca/ca.crt

# With client cert (should succeed)
curl https://localhost:2801/healthz \
  --cacert certs/ca/ca.crt \
  --cert certs/clients/local.crt \
  --key certs/clients/local.key
```

See [Security Hardening](../docs/security-hardening.md) for complete mTLS documentation.

## Testing

Generate a test alert:
```bash
# HTTP mode
curl -X POST http://localhost:2801/test

# mTLS mode
curl -X POST https://localhost:2801/test \
  --cacert certs/ca/ca.crt \
  --cert certs/clients/local.crt \
  --key certs/clients/local.key
```
